Generic Modules
---------------

  now has the first element the installation directory of the superbuild. This 
  is to ensure that if a package is available in the system but it is disabled
  using ``USE_SYSTEM_<package>`` set to ``OFF``, the version installed by the 
  superbuild is the one found by the other packages in the superbuild.

  :cmake-commit:`c89d2f4a6ae3e6cb0f87493cac3f5f723bb4f62e`).

  modules imported from `Catch2 Git Repository`_.
